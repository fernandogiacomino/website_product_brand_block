## ✨ Features

- Displays brand logo and name on product detail pages.
- Clickable block linking to `/shop/brands?brand=<brand_id>`.
- Tooltip with brand name for accessibility.
- CSS hover effect with scale and yellow tint.
- Fully modular and upgrade-safe.

   ```
2. Restart your Odoo server.
3. Activate developer mode.
